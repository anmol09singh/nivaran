# Supabase Storage Setup for Post Images

## Steps to Enable Image Uploads

### 1. Create Storage Bucket in Supabase Dashboard

1. Go to your Supabase project: https://lllkajthdvqzgbbbpcpa.supabase.co
2. Navigate to **Storage** in the left sidebar
3. Click **New bucket**
4. Enter bucket name: `post-images`
5. Make it **Public** (check the public checkbox)
6. Click **Create bucket**

### 2. Set Up Storage Policies

You can either:

**Option A: Use the SQL Editor**
1. Go to **SQL Editor** in Supabase dashboard
2. Run the contents of `storage-setup.sql` file

**Option B: Manual Policy Setup**
1. Go to **Storage** ‚Üí **Policies** tab
2. Add the following policies for `post-images` bucket:

   - **Upload Policy**: Allow authenticated users to upload to their folder
     ```sql
     CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload images"
     ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
     TO authenticated
     WITH CHECK (
         bucket_id = 'post-images' AND
         (storage.foldername(name))[1] = 'posts' AND
         (storage.foldername(name))[2] = auth.uid()::text
     );
     ```

   - **View Policy**: Allow public access to view images
     ```sql
     CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view images"
     ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
     TO public
     USING (bucket_id = 'post-images');
     ```

   - **Delete Policy**: Allow users to delete their own images
     ```sql
     CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own images"
     ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
     TO authenticated
     USING (
         bucket_id = 'post-images' AND
         (storage.foldername(name))[2] = auth.uid()::text
     );
     ```

### 3. Verify Setup

After setup, the folder structure will be:
```
post-images/
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ posts/
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {user_id}/
          ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {random_name}_{timestamp}.{ext}
```

### 4. Test Upload

1. Log in to your Nivaran application
2. Go to Feed page
3. Click the image icon (üñºÔ∏è) when creating a post
4. Select 1-4 images (max 5MB each)
5. Create the post
6. Images should appear in the post

## Troubleshooting

If images don't upload:

3. Ensure storage policies are correctly set
4. Check that user is authenticated
5. Verify image file size is under 5MB
